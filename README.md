Our goal is to create a simple Java project for images elaboration. This and world domination, of course.

Method we can use to enhance edge detection:

1) Starting from the histogram of the image, equlize it and some way folloew the edges???

2) Apply to the image a filter (based for example of a 3x3 matrix..) in order to otain a sharper version the image. Then apply sobel filter to edge detection.

3) Apply to the image the DoG operator in order to obtain the edge detection. This method is better than the previous one in case of noise...

4) Apply to the image the Canny operator in order to obtain the edge detection.
